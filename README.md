# CarExpo
Product listing purely based on AJAX and json.<br/>
Please run the project using a code editor server for e.g. Brackets or Sublime.Or else you could make use of any browser plugins to create a server for e.g: Chrome Plugin: <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en">Web Server for Chrome</a>.<br/>
Since it makes use of AJAX hence it wont display the desired results without a server, it will throw a CrossOrigin error.<br/>
The project was built using:
  1. HTML
  2. CSS
  3. jQuery
  4. jQuery AJAX
  5. JSON(used to store the data)<br/>

The entire products data is stored in json format. Using jQuery AJAX method the data is pulled from the json file and displayed to the user. You can switch between the two display modes either Grid or List.
